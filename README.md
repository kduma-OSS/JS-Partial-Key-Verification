# Partial Key Verification Library for TS/JS

[![Tests](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/kduma-OSS/JS-Partial-Key-Verification/node.js.yml?branch=master&label=build&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/kduma-OSS/JS-Partial-Key-Verification/actions/workflows/run-tests.yml)

This is a port of my other C# library [Partial Key Verification Library for Compact Framework](https://opensource.duma.sh/libraries/net/partial-key-verification) into a JavaScript/TypeScript package.

This library implements Partial Key Verification (PKV). PKV is a cryptographic technique that allows verification of a subset of a key without revealing the entire key, enhancing security and privacy in various applications.
